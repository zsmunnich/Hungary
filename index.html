    <h3>Culture and Hungaricums</h3>
    <p>The culture of Hungary varies greatly across Hungary. It includes varying folk crafts, such as embroidery, decorated pottery and carvings. Hungarian music includes classical and baroque pieces along with folk music, modern pop and Roma music. Noted Hungarian authors include Sándor Márai, Imre Kertész, Péter Esterházy, Magda Szabó and János Kodolányi. Imre Kertész is particularly notworthy for having won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2002.</p>
    <p><strong>Hungaricums</strong> are high value products of Hungary, which show Hungarian uniqueness, speciality and quality, they embody the top performance of the Hungarian people. You might have already heard of some of them – maybe even tasted or participated in one – but here is a list of Hungaricums that you should know about!
    <p><em>Táncház Method</em>
    <br>The Táncház (dance-house) model is a special method of teaching folk dance and preserving intangible cultural heritage: participants learn dances from tradition bearers by observation and imitation, with the accompaniment of live music.
    <br>More information can be found <a href="http://tanchaz.hu/index.php/en/">here</a>.</p>
    <p><em>Busó Festivities</em>
    <br>This is an annual festival in Mohács, located in southern Hungary. These festivities are held in late February to mark the end of winter. The event lasts for six days. The festival is named ‘busó’ in acknowledgement of the awesome-looking costumed men wearing wooden masks and large sheepskin coats. According to legend, the roots of the festival date back to the Battle of Mohács in 1526, when villagers dressed up as fearsome monsters to frighten away the occupying Turkish forces.

    <p><em>Debrecen Flower Carnival</em>
    <br>Debrecen Flower Carnival is among the most famous cultural events in Hungary. Flower compositions with  international groups of dancers and artists march along the avenues of Debrecen on the festival's main event on 20th August.

    <p><em>Pálinka</em>

    <p></p><em>Porcelain of Herend</em>
    <br>Herend offers luxury hand painted and gilded porcelain. Now amongst the biggest porcelain manufactories in Europe, the Herend Porcelain manufactory was founded in 1826 in a small Hungarian village. In 1855, the international exhibition in Paris brought the highest appreciation for Herend.</p>
    <p><em>Matyó Embroidery</em>
    <br>The Matyó community lives in and around the town of Mezőkövesd. The heritage of the community consists of the ethnographic group’s living traditional culture, which is embodied by their characteristic style, colourful folk art and unique costumes, as well as a cultural identity imbued with strong Catholic religiosity. This folk art is characterised by special floral embroidery filling on textile and ornamented objects.</p>
    <p><em>Hungarian Paprika</em>
    <br>Paprika powder is one of the most widely used spices in Hungarian cuisine. Due to the favourable climate and geographical conditions, Hungarian paprika has a bright red colour and a distinctively rich flavour. Kalocsa and Szeged in the southern part of Hungary are the heart of paprika production.</p>
    <p><em>Makó Onion</em>
    <br>The town of Makó, situated in south-eastern Hungary, is famous for its onion which is an important ingredient of traditional Hungarian cuisine. An international onion festival is organised in the region each year, which lasts for three days.</p>
    <p><em>Tokaji Aszú</em>
    <br>Described by Louis XIV of France as “the king of wines and the wine of kings”, Aszú is in fact even referred to in the Hungarian national anthem. It is one of the world’s finest dessert wines.</p>
    <p><em>Original Hungarian Winter salami</em>
    <br>The PICK factory in Szeged has been producing this famous and popular salami brand for about 140 years, using a secret recipe. Made from pork and spices, winter salami is cured in cold air and is slowly smoked. Known as one of the best salami in Hungary and in the world.</p>

    <h3>Cuisine</h3>
    <p>Traditional dishes such as the world-famous <em>Goulash</em> (gulyás stew or gulyásleves soup) are popular. Dishes are often flavoured with <em>paprika</em> (ground red peppers). Thick, heavy Hungarian sour cream called <em>tejföl</em> is often used to soften the dish's flavour. The famous Hungarian hot river fish soup called Fisherman's soup or <em>halászlé</em> is usually a rich mixture of several kinds of poached fish.
    Other dishes include <em>chicken paprikash</em>, foie gras made of goose liver, <em>pörkölt stew</em>, <em>vadas</em> (game stew with vegetable gravy and dumplings), trout with almonds or salty and sweet dumplings, and <em>túrós csusza</em>, (dumplings with fresh quark cheese and thick sour cream). Desserts include the iconic <em>Dobos Cake</em>, <em>Strudel (rétes)</em>, filled with apple, cherry, poppy seeds or cheese, <em>Gundel pancake</em>, <em>plum dumplings (szilvás gombóc)</em>, <em>somlói dumplings</em>, dessert soups like <em>chilled sour cherry soup</em>, and <em>sweet chestnut puree (gesztenyepüré)</em> (cooked chestnuts mashed with sugar and rum, split into crumbs, and topped with whipped cream). <em>Perec</em> and <em>kifli</em> are widely popular pastries.
    The <em>csárda</em> is the most distinctive type of Hungarian inn, an old-style tavern offering traditional cuisine and beverages. <em>Borozó</em> usually denotes a cozy old-fashioned wine tavern, <em>pince</em> is a beer or wine cellar, and a <em>söröző</em> is a pub offering draught beer and sometimes meals. The <em>bisztró</em> is an inexpensive restaurant often with self-service. The <em>büfé</em> is the cheapest place, although one may have to eat standing at a counter. Pastries, cake, and coffee are served at a <em>cukrászda</em>, while an <em>eszpresszó</em> is a cafeteria.</p>

    <h3>Money</h3>
    <p>The <em>forint</em> (sign Ft; code HUF) is the currency of Hungary. It was formerly divided into 100 fillér, but fillér coins are no longer in circulation. The introduction of the forint on 1 August 1946 was a crucial step in the post-World War II stabilisation of the Hungarian economy, and the currency remained relatively stable until the 1980s. Transition to a market economy in the early 1990s adversely affected the value of the forint; inflation peaked at 35% in 1991. Since 2001, inflation is in single digits, and the forint has been declared fully convertible. As a member of the European Union, the long-term aim of the Hungarian government may be to replace the forint with the euro, but that does not appear to be likely until some time during the 2020s.</p>

In most of the time is dry weather with sunny spells, although sometimes heavy Thunderstorms can occur at the end of the day. July is the warmest month with an average Temperature of 22°C. Annual Precipitation is about 400-600 mm in the lowland areas, but more in the mountainous regions.
